### Hi there 👋

I'm a JavaScript and React Web Developer with a deep interest in AI, VR, and CS. Based on marketing experience, digital marketing tools, and a social science background - but year to year computer science and maths became more and more my priority, so now I'm in the Web Dev industry.   

## Current Project
